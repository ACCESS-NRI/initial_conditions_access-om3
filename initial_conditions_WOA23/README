# Initial Condition Files for MOM Ocean Grids Using World Ocean Atlas 2023 (WOA23)

This repository contains the tools and scripts to generate initial condition files for 3 MOM ocean grids from World Ocean Atlas 2023 (WOA23) data. The repository leverages Nic Hannah's `ocean-ic` code for interpolating the salt and temperature fields onto the 3D MOM ocean grids.

# Generate Initial Conditions

This script generates initial condition files for a specific MOM ocean grid using WOA23 data. The grid and data paths are provided as environment variables, execute the following script with the grid, input and output directories as a command-line argument:

qsub -v GRIDDIR="<path_to_grid_directory>",INPUT_DIR="<path_to_input_directory>",OUTPUT_DIR="<path_to_output_directory>" -P $PROJECT make_initial_conditions.sh
