# Initial Condition Files for MOM Ocean Grids Using World Ocean Atlas 2023 (WOA23)

This repository contains the tools and scripts to generate initial condition files for 3 MOM ocean grids from World Ocean Atlas 2023 (WOA23) data. The repository leverages Nic Hannah's `ocean-ic` code for interpolating the salt and temperature fields onto the 3D MOM ocean grids.

# Generate Initial Conditions

To generate initial condition files for a specific MOM ocean grid, execute the following script with the grid resolution as a command-line argument:

./make_initial_conditions.sh <grid>
